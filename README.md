## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites

-   **Java 17** or later
-   **Maven**
-   **Docker** (preferable, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yassinekrn/yassinekrn-real-time-api-spring-boot.git
    cd yassinekrn-real-time-api-spring-boot
    ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```env
    APP_JWT_SECRET=<your_secret_key>
    APP_JWT_EXPIRATION_IN_MS=<duration_in_milliseconds>
    # Uncomment one of the following lines based on your environment
    # OLLAMA_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/api/generate (for local development)
    # OLLAMA_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/generate (for Docker)
    OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME=<model_name>
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://frontend1.com,https://frontend2.com (must be comma-separated)
    ```

3. **Update `application.properties`:**

    Before building the JAR file, ensure the following configuration is set:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blogdb?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    ```

    For Docker deployment, comment the above line and use:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql-db:3306/blogdb
    ```

4. **Build the project using Maven:**

    ```bash
    ./mvn clean package
    ```

5. **Build and run Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Configuration ⚙️

### Environment Variables and custom configurations

-   **CORS:** Configurable via environment variables to manage allowed domains. (refer to step 2 in the installation section)
-   **Security:** JWT-based authentication is set up with role-based access. (only 2 roles are available by default: `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_ADMIN`. also, please refer to step 2 in the installation section)
-   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented using Bucket4j to prevent API abuse. (set to 10 requests per minute by default, could be changed in `RateLimitingFilterConfig.java`).

_All configurations are managed via `application.properties` and the `.env` file._
_You can also check the `utils/Constants.java` file for additional configuration constants._

### Note on Admin Role 🛡️

If you want to add the admin role, you will need to manually insert it into the database.

Connect to the database and run the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');
```
